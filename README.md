# PostMan clone
This is a simple app written in LWCOSS, can be used to test rest endpoints.

# How to start?
Start simple by running `yarn watch` (or `npm run watch`, if you set up the project with `npm`). This will start the project with a local development server.
The source files are located in the [`src`](./src) folder. All web components are within the [`src/client/modules`](./src/modules) folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components. The entry file for the custom Express configuration can be found in the ['src/server'](./src/server) folder.
